# Calculator

This Python program implements a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulus (Remainder)
- Exponentiation

## How it Works
The program prompts the user to enter the first number, then asks for an arithmetic operation symbol, and finally requests the second number. It performs the calculation and displays the result. The user can choose to continue with the previous result or start a new calculation.

## Requirements
- Python 3

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ezzy401k/calculator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd calculator
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to enter numbers and select operations.

## Example

```python
python calculator.py
```

```
First number: 4
```
```
what operation do you want: +
```
```
next number: 2
```
```
The result of the calculation is,
4 + 2 = 6
```
```
Input 'y' to do more calculations with the previous answer or 'n' to start a new calculation.
```
